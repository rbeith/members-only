Project: Members Only!
Ruby on Rails Course
Introduction

In these projects, you’ll be working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.
Project: Members Only!

In this project, you’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
